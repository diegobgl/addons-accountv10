Account Bank Statement No Reconcile Guess
=========================================

Here is a scenario where the "reconcile guess" feature is a problem for the accountant:

1) The accountant imports a large bank statement with 40 bank statement lines.
2) The "reconcile guess" feature will pre-select reconcile of line X with line 39 of the bank statement. But this guess is a mistake and line X should be reconciled with line 2 of the bank statement.
=> The accountant will not understand why he can't select line X to be reconciled with line 2 of the bank statement. To be able to reconcile line 2 correctif, he has to:
3) click several times on the "next page" button to reach line 39 of the bank statement and unselect line X.
4) Go back to line 2 of the bank statement and now he will be able to select line X.

This module disables the "reconcile guess" feature to avoid this problem.
